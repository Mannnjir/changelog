  You can add links in your app to these routes
  /changelog/release_notes - to display all versions with their user stories (only versions with at least one story will be displayed)
  /changelog/current_release - to display only latest release (by release_date) (only versions with at least one story will be displayed)
4.
  Changelog creates two rake tasks:
  a) rake changelog:build[label]
    This allows to get from PivotalTracker user stories with given label.
    This also automatically creates changelog_version in changelog.yml file with name set to given label an date set to 'Unreleased'
  b) rake changelog:release
    This searches changelog.yml file and sets 'Unreleased' date values to current date.

  You are ready to go!

All data will be saved in changelog.yml file in your application root directory. You can open it and change contents in any text editor.
